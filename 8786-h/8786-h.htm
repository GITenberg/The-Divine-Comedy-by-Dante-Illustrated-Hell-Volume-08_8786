<h2>CANTO XXIII</h2>
<br>

<p>IN silence and in solitude we went,<br>
One first, the other following his steps,<br>
As minor friars journeying on their road.<br>
<br>The present fray had turn'd my thoughts to muse<br>
Upon old Aesop's fable, where he told<br>
What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.<br>
For language hath not sounds more like in sense,<br>
Than are these chances, if the origin<br>
And end of each be heedfully compar'd.<br>
And as one thought bursts from another forth,<br>
So afterward from that another sprang,<br>
Which added doubly to my former fear.<br>
For thus I reason'd: "These through us have been<br>
So foil'd, with loss and mock'ry so complete,<br>
As needs must sting them sore. &nbsp;If anger then<br>
Be to their evil will conjoin'd, more fell<br>
They shall pursue us, than the savage hound<br>
Snatches the leveret, panting 'twixt his jaws."<br>
<br>Already I perceiv'd my hair stand all<br>
On end with terror, and look'd eager back.<br>
<br>"Teacher," I thus began, "if speedily<br>
Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread<br>
Those evil talons. &nbsp;Even now behind<br>
They urge us: quick imagination works<br>
So forcibly, that I already feel them."<br>
<br>He answer'd: "Were I form'd of leaded glass,<br>
I should not sooner draw unto myself<br>
Thy outward image, than I now imprint<br>
That from within. &nbsp;This moment came thy thoughts<br>
Presented before mine, with similar act<br>
And count'nance similar, so that from both<br>
I one design have fram'd. &nbsp;If the right coast<br>
Incline so much, that we may thence descend<br>
Into the other chasm, we shall escape<br>
Secure from this imagined pursuit."<br>
<br>He had not spoke his purpose to the end,<br>
When I from far beheld them with spread wings<br>
Approach to take us. &nbsp;Suddenly my guide<br>
Caught me, ev'n as a mother that from sleep<br>
Is by the noise arous'd, and near her sees<br>
The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe<br>
And flies ne'er pausing, careful more of him<br>
Than of herself, that but a single vest<br>
Clings round her limbs. &nbsp;Down from the jutting beach<br>
Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,<br>
Which closes on one part the other chasm.<br>
<br>Never ran water with such hurrying pace<br>
Adown the tube to turn a landmill's wheel,<br>
When nearest it approaches to the spokes,<br>
As then along that edge my master ran,<br>
Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,<br>
Not a companion. &nbsp;Scarcely had his feet<br>
Reach'd to the lowest of the bed beneath,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/23-219.jpg"><img alt="23-219b.jpg (43K)" src="images/23-219b.jpg" height="545" width="356"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


When over us the steep they reach'd; but fear<br>
In him was none; for that high Providence,<br>
Which plac'd them ministers of the fifth foss,<br>
Power of departing thence took from them all.<br>
<br>There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,<br>
Who pac'd with tardy steps around, and wept,<br>
Faint in appearance and o'ercome with toil.<br>
Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down<br>
Before their eyes, in fashion like to those<br>
Worn by the monks in Cologne. &nbsp;Their outside<br>
Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,<br>
But leaden all within, and of such weight,<br>
That Frederick's compar'd to these were straw.<br>
Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!<br>
<br>We yet once more with them together turn'd<br>
To leftward, on their dismal moan intent.<br>
But by the weight oppress'd, so slowly came<br>
The fainting people, that our company<br>
Was chang'd at every movement of the step.<br>
<br>Whence I my guide address'd: "See that thou find<br>
Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,<br>
And to that end look round thee as thou go'st."<br>
<br>Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,<br>
Cried after us aloud: "Hold in your feet,<br>
Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.<br>
Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish."<br>
<br>Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:<br>
"Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed."<br>
<br>I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look<br>
Impatient eagerness of mind was mark'd<br>
To overtake me; but the load they bare<br>
And narrow path retarded their approach.<br>
<br>Soon as arriv'd, they with an eye askance<br>
Perus'd me, but spake not: then turning each<br>
To other thus conferring said: "This one<br>
Seems, by the action of his throat, alive.<br>
And, be they dead, what privilege allows<br>
They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/23-223.jpg"><img alt="23-223b.jpg (45K)" src="images/23-223b.jpg" height="413" width="491"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>Then thus to me: "Tuscan, who visitest<br>
The college of the mourning hypocrites,<br>
Disdain not to instruct us who thou art."<br>
<br>"By Arno's pleasant stream," I thus replied,<br>
"In the great city I was bred and grew,<br>
And wear the body I have ever worn.<br>
but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,<br>
As now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?<br>
What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?"<br>
"Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,"<br>
One of them answer'd, "are so leaden gross,<br>
That with their weight they make the balances<br>
To crack beneath them. &nbsp;Joyous friars we were,<br>
Bologna's natives, Catalano I,<br>
He Loderingo nam'd, and by thy land<br>
Together taken, as men used to take<br>
A single and indifferent arbiter,<br>
To reconcile their strifes. &nbsp;How there we sped,<br>
Gardingo's vicinage can best declare."<br>
<br>"O friars!" &nbsp;I began, "your miseries&mdash;"<br>
But there brake off, for one had caught my eye,<br>
Fix'd to a cross with three stakes on the ground:<br>
He, when he saw me, writh'd himself, throughout<br>
Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard.<br>
And Catalano, who thereof was 'ware,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/23-225.jpg"><img alt="23-225b.jpg (46K)" src="images/23-225b.jpg" height="558" width="353"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Thus spake: "That pierced spirit, whom intent<br>
Thou view'st, was he who gave the Pharisees<br>
Counsel, that it were fitting for one man<br>
To suffer for the people. &nbsp;He doth lie<br>
Transverse; nor any passes, but him first<br>
Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs.<br>
In straits like this along the foss are plac'd<br>
The father of his consort, and the rest<br>
Partakers in that council, seed of ill<br>
And sorrow to the Jews." &nbsp;I noted then,<br>
How Virgil gaz'd with wonder upon him,<br>
Thus abjectly extended on the cross<br>
In banishment eternal. &nbsp;To the friar<br>
He next his words address'd: "We pray ye tell,<br>
If so be lawful, whether on our right<br>
Lies any opening in the rock, whereby<br>
We both may issue hence, without constraint<br>
On the dark angels, that compell'd they come<br>
To lead us from this depth." &nbsp;He thus replied:<br>
"Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock<br>
From the next circle moving, which o'ersteps<br>
Each vale of horror, save that here his cope<br>
Is shatter'd. &nbsp;By the ruin ye may mount:<br>
For on the side it slants, and most the height<br>
Rises below." &nbsp;With head bent down awhile<br>
My leader stood, then spake: "He warn'd us ill,<br>
Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook."<br>
<br>To whom the friar: "At Bologna erst<br>
I many vices of the devil heard,<br>
Among the rest was said, 'He is a liar,<br>
And the father of lies!'" &nbsp;When he had spoke,<br>
My leader with large strides proceeded on,<br>
Somewhat disturb'd with anger in his look.<br>
<br>I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,<br>
And following, his beloved footsteps mark'd.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXIV</h2>
<br>

<p>IN the year's early nonage, when the sun<br>
Tempers his tresses in Aquarius' urn,<br>
And now towards equal day the nights recede,<br>
When as the rime upon the earth puts on<br>
Her dazzling sister's image, but not long<br>
Her milder sway endures, then riseth up<br>
The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,<br>
And looking out beholds the plain around<br>
All whiten'd, whence impatiently he smites<br>
His thighs, and to his hut returning in,<br>
There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,<br>
As a discomfited and helpless man;<br>
Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope<br>
Spring in his bosom, finding e'en thus soon<br>
The world hath chang'd its count'nance, grasps his crook,<br>
And forth to pasture drives his little flock:<br>
So me my guide dishearten'd when I saw<br>
His troubled forehead, and so speedily<br>
That ill was cur'd; for at the fallen bridge<br>
Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,<br>
He turn'd him back, as that I first beheld<br>
At the steep mountain's foot. &nbsp;Regarding well<br>
The ruin, and some counsel first maintain'd<br>
With his own thought, he open'd wide his arm<br>
And took me up. &nbsp;As one, who, while he works,<br>
Computes his labour's issue, that he seems<br>
Still to foresee the' effect, so lifting me<br>
Up to the summit of one peak, he fix'd<br>
His eye upon another. &nbsp;"Grapple that,"<br>
Said he, "but first make proof, if it be such<br>
As will sustain thee." &nbsp;For one capp'd with lead<br>
This were no journey. &nbsp;Scarcely he, though light,<br>
And I, though onward push'd from crag to crag,<br>
Could mount. &nbsp;And if the precinct of this coast<br>
Were not less ample than the last, for him<br>
I know not, but my strength had surely fail'd.<br>
But Malebolge all toward the mouth<br>
Inclining of the nethermost abyss,<br>
The site of every valley hence requires,<br>
That one side upward slope, the other fall.<br>
<br>At length the point of our descent we reach'd<br>
From the last flag: soon as to that arriv'd,<br>
So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,<br>
I could no further, but did seat me there.<br>
<br>"Now needs thy best of man;" so spake my guide:<br>
"For not on downy plumes, nor under shade<br>
Of canopy reposing, fame is won,<br>
Without which whosoe'er consumes his days<br>
Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,<br>
As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.<br>
Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness<br>
By the mind's effort, in each struggle form'd<br>
To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight<br>
Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.<br>
A longer ladder yet remains to scale.<br>
From these to have escap'd sufficeth not.<br>
If well thou note me, profit by my words."<br>
<br>I straightway rose, and show'd myself less spent<br>
Than I in truth did feel me. &nbsp;"On," I cried,<br>
"For I am stout and fearless." &nbsp;Up the rock<br>
Our way we held, more rugged than before,<br>
Narrower and steeper far to climb. &nbsp;From talk<br>
I ceas'd not, as we journey'd, so to seem<br>
Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss<br>
Did issue forth, for utt'rance suited ill.<br>
Though on the arch that crosses there I stood,<br>
What were the words I knew not, but who spake<br>
Seem'd mov'd in anger. &nbsp;Down I stoop'd to look,<br>
But my quick eye might reach not to the depth<br>
For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:<br>
"To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,<br>
And from the wall dismount we; for as hence<br>
I hear and understand not, so I see<br>
Beneath, and naught discern."&mdash;"I answer not,"<br>
Said he, "but by the deed. &nbsp;To fair request<br>
Silent performance maketh best return."<br>
<br>We from the bridge's head descended, where<br>
To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm<br>
Opening to view, I saw a crowd within<br>
Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape<br>
And hideous, that remembrance in my veins<br>
Yet shrinks the vital current. &nbsp;Of her sands<br>
Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,<br>
Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,<br>
Cenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire<br>
Or in such numbers swarming ne'er she shew'd,<br>
Not with all Ethiopia, and whate'er<br>
Above the Erythraean sea is spawn'd.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/24-233.jpg"><img alt="24-233b.jpg (56K)" src="images/24-233b.jpg" height="417" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>Amid this dread exuberance of woe<br>
Ran naked spirits wing'd with horrid fear,<br>
Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,<br>
Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.<br>
With serpents were their hands behind them bound,<br>
Which through their reins infix'd the tail and head<br>
Twisted in folds before. &nbsp;And lo! on one<br>
Near to our side, darted an adder up,<br>
And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,<br>
Transpierc'd him. &nbsp;Far more quickly than e'er pen<br>
Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn'd, and chang'd<br>
To ashes, all pour'd out upon the earth.<br>
When there dissolv'd he lay, the dust again<br>
Uproll'd spontaneous, and the self-same form<br>
Instant resumed. &nbsp;So mighty sages tell,<br>
The' Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years<br>
Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith<br>
Renascent. &nbsp;Blade nor herb throughout his life<br>
He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone<br>
And odorous amomum: swaths of nard<br>
And myrrh his funeral shroud. &nbsp;As one that falls,<br>
He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg'd<br>
To earth, or through obstruction fettering up<br>
In chains invisible the powers of man,<br>
Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,<br>
Bewilder'd with the monstrous agony<br>
He hath endur'd, and wildly staring sighs;<br>
So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.<br>
<br>Oh! how severe God's judgment, that deals out<br>
Such blows in stormy vengeance! &nbsp;Who he was<br>
My teacher next inquir'd, and thus in few<br>
He answer'd: "Vanni Fucci am I call'd,<br>
Not long since rained down from Tuscany<br>
To this dire gullet. &nbsp;Me the beastial life<br>
And not the human pleas'd, mule that I was,<br>
Who in Pistoia found my worthy den."<br>
<br>I then to Virgil: "Bid him stir not hence,<br>
And ask what crime did thrust him hither: once<br>
A man I knew him choleric and bloody."<br>
<br>The sinner heard and feign'd not, but towards me<br>
His mind directing and his face, wherein<br>
Was dismal shame depictur'd, thus he spake:<br>
"It grieves me more to have been caught by thee<br>
In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than<br>
When I was taken from the other life.<br>
I have no power permitted to deny<br>
What thou inquirest." &nbsp;I am doom'd thus low<br>
To dwell, for that the sacristy by me<br>
Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,<br>
And with the guilt another falsely charged.<br>
But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,<br>
So as thou e'er shalt 'scape this darksome realm<br>
Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.<br>
Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,<br>
Then Florence changeth citizens and laws.<br>
From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,<br>
A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,<br>
And sharp and eager driveth on the storm<br>
With arrowy hurtling o'er Piceno's field,<br>
Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike<br>
Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.<br>
This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart."</p>

<br><br>

<h2>CANTO XXV</h2>
<br>

<p>WHEN he had spoke, the sinner rais'd his hands<br>
Pointed in mockery, and cried: "Take them, God!<br>
I level them at thee!" &nbsp;From that day forth<br>
The serpents were my friends; for round his neck<br>
One of then rolling twisted, as it said,<br>
"Be silent, tongue!" &nbsp;Another to his arms<br>
Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself<br>
So close, it took from them the power to move.<br>
<br>Pistoia! Ah Pistoia! why dost doubt<br>
To turn thee into ashes, cumb'ring earth<br>
No longer, since in evil act so far<br>
Thou hast outdone thy seed? &nbsp;I did not mark,<br>
Through all the gloomy circles of the' abyss,<br>
Spirit, that swell'd so proudly 'gainst his God,<br>
Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes. &nbsp;He fled,<br>
Nor utter'd more; and after him there came<br>
A centaur full of fury, shouting, "Where<br>
Where is the caitiff?" &nbsp;On Maremma's marsh<br>
Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch<br>
They swarm'd, to where the human face begins.<br>
Behind his head upon the shoulders lay,<br>
With open wings, a dragon breathing fire<br>
On whomsoe'er he met. &nbsp;To me my guide:<br>
"Cacus is this, who underneath the rock<br>
Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.<br>
He, from his brethren parted, here must tread<br>
A different journey, for his fraudful theft<br>
Of the great herd, that near him stall'd; whence found<br>
His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace<br>
Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on<br>
A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt."<br>
<br>While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:<br>
And under us three spirits came, of whom<br>
Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim'd;<br>
"Say who are ye?" &nbsp;We then brake off discourse,<br>
Intent on these alone. &nbsp;I knew them not;<br>
But, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one<br>
Had need to name another. &nbsp;"Where," said he,<br>
"Doth Cianfa lurk?" &nbsp;I, for a sign my guide<br>
Should stand attentive, plac'd against my lips<br>
The finger lifted. &nbsp;If, O reader! now<br>
Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,<br>
No marvel; for myself do scarce allow<br>
The witness of mine eyes. &nbsp;But as I looked<br>
Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet<br>
Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:<br>
His midmost grasp'd the belly, a forefoot<br>
Seiz'd on each arm (while deep in either cheek<br>
He flesh'd his fangs); the hinder on the thighs<br>
Were spread, 'twixt which the tail inserted curl'd<br>
Upon the reins behind. &nbsp;Ivy ne'er clasp'd<br>
A dodder'd oak, as round the other's limbs<br>
The hideous monster intertwin'd his own.<br>
Then, as they both had been of burning wax,<br>
Each melted into other, mingling hues,<br>
That which was either now was seen no more.<br>
Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,<br>
A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,<br>
And the clean white expires. &nbsp;The other two<br>
Look'd on exclaiming: "Ah, how dost thou change,<br>
Agnello! &nbsp;See! &nbsp;Thou art nor double now,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/25-239.jpg"><img alt="25-239b.jpg (52K)" src="images/25-239b.jpg" height="546" width="358"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"Nor only one." &nbsp;The two heads now became<br>
One, and two figures blended in one form<br>
Appear'd, where both were lost. &nbsp;Of the four lengths<br>
Two arms were made: the belly and the chest<br>
The thighs and legs into such members chang'd,<br>
As never eye hath seen. &nbsp;Of former shape<br>
All trace was vanish'd. &nbsp;Two yet neither seem'd<br>
That image miscreate, and so pass'd on<br>
With tardy steps. &nbsp;As underneath the scourge<br>
Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,<br>
Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems<br>
A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,<br>
So toward th' entrails of the other two<br>
Approaching seem'd, an adder all on fire,<br>
As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart.<br>
In that part, whence our life is nourish'd first,<br>
One he transpierc'd; then down before him fell<br>
Stretch'd out. &nbsp;The pierced spirit look'd on him<br>
But spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn'd,<br>
As if by sleep or fev'rous fit assail'd.<br>
He ey'd the serpent, and the serpent him.<br>
One from the wound, the other from the mouth<br>
Breath'd a thick smoke, whose vap'ry columns join'd.<br>
<br>Lucan in mute attention now may hear,<br>
Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,<br>
Nor shine, Nasidius! &nbsp;Ovid now be mute.<br>
What if in warbling fiction he record<br>
Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake<br>
Him chang'd, and her into a fountain clear,<br>
I envy not; for never face to face<br>
Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,<br>
Wherein both shapes were ready to assume<br>
The other's substance. &nbsp;They in mutual guise<br>
So answer'd, that the serpent split his train<br>
Divided to a fork, and the pierc'd spirit<br>
Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs<br>
Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon<br>
Was visible: the tail disparted took<br>
The figure which the spirit lost, its skin<br>
Soft'ning, his indurated to a rind.<br>
The shoulders next I mark'd, that ent'ring join'd<br>
The monster's arm-pits, whose two shorter feet<br>
So lengthen'd, as the other's dwindling shrunk.<br>
The feet behind then twisting up became<br>
That part that man conceals, which in the wretch<br>
Was cleft in twain. &nbsp;While both the shadowy smoke<br>
With a new colour veils, and generates<br>
Th' excrescent pile on one, peeling it off<br>
From th' other body, lo! upon his feet<br>
One upright rose, and prone the other fell.<br>
Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps<br>
Were shifted, though each feature chang'd beneath.<br>
Of him who stood erect, the mounting face<br>
Retreated towards the temples, and what there<br>
Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears<br>
From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg'd,<br>
Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell'd<br>
Into due size protuberant the lips.<br>
He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends<br>
His sharpen'd visage, and draws down the ears<br>
Into the head, as doth the slug his horns.<br>
His tongue continuous before and apt<br>
For utt'rance, severs; and the other's fork<br>
Closing unites. &nbsp;That done the smoke was laid.<br>
The soul, transform'd into the brute, glides off,<br>
Hissing along the vale, and after him<br>
The other talking sputters; but soon turn'd<br>
His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few<br>
Thus to another spake: "Along this path<br>
Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!"<br>
<br>So saw I fluctuate in successive change<br>
Th' unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:<br>
And here if aught my tongue have swerv'd, events<br>
So strange may be its warrant. &nbsp;O'er mine eyes<br>
Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze.<br>
<br>Yet 'scap'd they not so covertly, but well<br>
I mark'd Sciancato: he alone it was<br>
Of the three first that came, who chang'd not: thou,<br>
The other's fate, Gaville, still dost rue.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXVI</h2>
<br>

<p>FLORENCE exult! for thou so mightily<br>
Hast thriven, that o'er land and sea thy wings<br>
Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell!<br>
Among the plund'rers such the three I found<br>
Thy citizens, whence shame to me thy son,<br>
And no proud honour to thyself redounds.<br>
<br>But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,<br>
Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long<br>
Shalt feel what Prato, (not to say the rest)<br>
Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance<br>
Were in good time, if it befell thee now.<br>
Would so it were, since it must needs befall!<br>
For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more.<br>
<br>We from the depth departed; and my guide<br>
Remounting scal'd the flinty steps, which late<br>
We downward trac'd, and drew me up the steep.<br>
Pursuing thus our solitary way<br>
Among the crags and splinters of the rock,<br>
Sped not our feet without the help of hands.<br>
<br>Then sorrow seiz'd me, which e'en now revives,<br>
As my thought turns again to what I saw,<br>
And, more than I am wont, I rein and curb<br>
The powers of nature in me, lest they run<br>
Where Virtue guides not; that if aught of good<br>
My gentle star, or something better gave me,<br>
I envy not myself the precious boon.<br>
<br>As in that season, when the sun least veils<br>
His face that lightens all, what time the fly<br>
Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then<br>
Upon some cliff reclin'd, beneath him sees<br>
Fire-flies innumerous spangling o'er the vale,<br>
Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labour lies:<br>
With flames so numberless throughout its space<br>
Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth<br>
Was to my view expos'd. As he, whose wrongs<br>
The bears aveng'd, at its departure saw<br>
Elijah's chariot, when the steeds erect<br>
Rais'd their steep flight for heav'n; his eyes meanwhile,<br>
Straining pursu'd them, till the flame alone<br>
Upsoaring like a misty speck he kenn'd;<br>
E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame,<br>
A sinner so enfolded close in each,<br>
That none exhibits token of the theft.<br>
<br>Upon the bridge I forward bent to look,<br>
And grasp'd a flinty mass, or else had fall'n,<br>
Though push'd not from the height. &nbsp;The guide, who mark'd<br>
How I did gaze attentive, thus began:<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/26-245.jpg"><img alt="26-245b.jpg (42K)" src="images/26-245b.jpg" height="549" width="354"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"Within these ardours are the spirits, each<br>
Swath'd in confining fire."&mdash;"Master, thy word,"<br>
I answer'd, "hath assur'd me; yet I deem'd<br>
Already of the truth, already wish'd<br>
To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes<br>
So parted at the summit, as it seem'd<br>
Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay<br>
The Theban brothers?" &nbsp;He replied: "Within<br>
Ulysses there and Diomede endure<br>
Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now<br>
Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath.<br>
These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore<br>
The ambush of the horse, that open'd wide<br>
A portal for that goodly seed to pass,<br>
Which sow'd imperial Rome; nor less the guile<br>
Lament they, whence of her Achilles 'reft<br>
Deidamia yet in death complains.<br>
And there is rued the stratagem, that Troy<br>
Of her Palladium spoil'd."&mdash;"If they have power<br>
Of utt'rance from within these sparks," said I,<br>
"O master! think my prayer a thousand fold<br>
In repetition urg'd, that thou vouchsafe<br>
To pause, till here the horned flame arrive.<br>
See, how toward it with desire I bend."<br>
<br>He thus: "Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,<br>
And I accept it therefore: but do thou<br>
Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine,<br>
For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,<br>
For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee."<br>
<br>When there the flame had come, where time and place<br>
Seem'd fitting to my guide, he thus began:<br>
"O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!<br>
If living I of you did merit aught,<br>
Whate'er the measure were of that desert,<br>
When in the world my lofty strain I pour'd,<br>
Move ye not on, till one of you unfold<br>
In what clime death o'ertook him self-destroy'd."<br>
<br>Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn<br>
Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire<br>
That labours with the wind, then to and fro<br>
Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,<br>
Threw out its voice, and spake: "When I escap'd<br>
From Circe, who beyond a circling year<br>
Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,<br>
Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam'd the shore,<br>
Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence<br>
Of my old father, nor return of love,<br>
That should have crown'd Penelope with joy,<br>
Could overcome in me the zeal I had<br>
T' explore the world, and search the ways of life,<br>
Man's evil and his virtue. &nbsp;Forth I sail'd<br>
Into the deep illimitable main,<br>
With but one bark, and the small faithful band<br>
That yet cleav'd to me. &nbsp;As Iberia far,<br>
Far as Morocco either shore I saw,<br>
And the Sardinian and each isle beside<br>
Which round that ocean bathes. &nbsp;Tardy with age<br>
Were I and my companions, when we came<br>
To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain'd<br>
The bound'ries not to be o'erstepp'd by man.<br>
The walls of Seville to my right I left,<br>
On the' other hand already Ceuta past.<br>
"O brothers!" &nbsp;I began, "who to the west<br>
Through perils without number now have reach'd,<br>
To this the short remaining watch, that yet<br>
Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof<br>
Of the unpeopled world, following the track<br>
Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:<br>
Ye were not form'd to live the life of brutes<br>
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high."<br>
With these few words I sharpen'd for the voyage<br>
The mind of my associates, that I then<br>
Could scarcely have withheld them. &nbsp;To the dawn<br>
Our poop we turn'd, and for the witless flight<br>
Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left.<br>
Each star of the' other pole night now beheld,<br>
And ours so low, that from the ocean-floor<br>
It rose not. &nbsp;Five times re-illum'd, as oft<br>
Vanish'd the light from underneath the moon<br>
Since the deep way we enter'd, when from far<br>
Appear'd a mountain dim, loftiest methought<br>
Of all I e'er beheld. &nbsp;Joy seiz'd us straight,<br>
But soon to mourning changed. &nbsp;From the new land<br>
A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side<br>
Did strike the vessel. &nbsp;Thrice it whirl'd her round<br>
With all the waves, the fourth time lifted up<br>
The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:<br>
And over us the booming billow clos'd."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="27"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XVII</h2>
<br>

<p>NOW upward rose the flame, and still'd its light<br>
To speak no more, and now pass'd on with leave<br>
From the mild poet gain'd, when following came<br>
Another, from whose top a sound confus'd,<br>
Forth issuing, drew our eyes that way to look.<br>
<br>As the Sicilian bull, that rightfully<br>
His cries first echoed, who had shap'd its mould,<br>
Did so rebellow, with the voice of him<br>
Tormented, that the brazen monster seem'd<br>
Pierc'd through with pain; thus while no way they found<br>
Nor avenue immediate through the flame,<br>
Into its language turn'd the dismal words:<br>
But soon as they had won their passage forth,<br>
Up from the point, which vibrating obey'd<br>
Their motion at the tongue, these sounds we heard:<br>
"O thou! to whom I now direct my voice!<br>
That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase,<br>
<br>'Depart thou, I solicit thee no more,'<br>
Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive<br>
Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile,<br>
And with me parley: lo! it irks not me<br>
And yet I burn. &nbsp;If but e'en now thou fall<br>
into this blind world, from that pleasant land<br>
Of Latium, whence I draw my sum of guilt,<br>
Tell me if those, who in Romagna dwell,<br>
Have peace or war. &nbsp;For of the mountains there<br>
Was I, betwixt Urbino and the height,<br>
Whence Tyber first unlocks his mighty flood."<br>
<br>Leaning I listen'd yet with heedful ear,<br>
When, as he touch'd my side, the leader thus:<br>
"Speak thou: he is a Latian." &nbsp;My reply<br>
Was ready, and I spake without delay:<br>
<br>"O spirit! who art hidden here below!<br>
Never was thy Romagna without war<br>
In her proud tyrants' bosoms, nor is now:<br>
But open war there left I none. &nbsp;The state,<br>
Ravenna hath maintain'd this many a year,<br>
Is steadfast. &nbsp;There Polenta's eagle broods,<br>
And in his broad circumference of plume<br>
O'ershadows Cervia. The green talons grasp<br>
The land, that stood erewhile the proof so long,<br>
And pil'd in bloody heap the host of France.<br>
<br>"The' old mastiff of Verruchio and the young,<br>
That tore Montagna in their wrath, still make,<br>
Where they are wont, an augre of their fangs.<br>
<br>"Lamone's city and Santerno's range<br>
Under the lion of the snowy lair.<br>
Inconstant partisan! that changeth sides,<br>
Or ever summer yields to winter's frost.<br>
And she, whose flank is wash'd of Savio's wave,<br>
As 'twixt the level and the steep she lies,<br>
Lives so 'twixt tyrant power and liberty.<br>
<br>"Now tell us, I entreat thee, who art thou?<br>
Be not more hard than others. &nbsp;In the world,<br>
So may thy name still rear its forehead high."<br>
<br>Then roar'd awhile the fire, its sharpen'd point<br>
On either side wav'd, and thus breath'd at last:<br>
"If I did think, my answer were to one,<br>
Who ever could return unto the world,<br>
This flame should rest unshaken. &nbsp;But since ne'er,<br>
If true be told me, any from this depth<br>
Has found his upward way, I answer thee,<br>
Nor fear lest infamy record the words.<br>
<br>"A man of arms at first, I cloth'd me then<br>
In good Saint Francis' girdle, hoping so<br>
T' have made amends. &nbsp;And certainly my hope<br>
Had fail'd not, but that he, whom curses light on,<br>
The' high priest again seduc'd me into sin.<br>
And how and wherefore listen while I tell.<br>
Long as this spirit mov'd the bones and pulp<br>
My mother gave me, less my deeds bespake<br>
The nature of the lion than the fox.<br>
All ways of winding subtlety I knew,<br>
And with such art conducted, that the sound<br>
Reach'd the world's limit. &nbsp;Soon as to that part<br>
Of life I found me come, when each behoves<br>
To lower sails and gather in the lines;<br>
That which before had pleased me then I rued,<br>
And to repentance and confession turn'd;<br>
Wretch that I was! and well it had bested me!<br>
The chief of the new Pharisees meantime,<br>
Waging his warfare near the Lateran,<br>
Not with the Saracens or Jews (his foes<br>
All Christians were, nor against Acre one<br>
Had fought, nor traffic'd in the Soldan's land),<br>
He his great charge nor sacred ministry<br>
In himself, rev'renc'd, nor in me that cord,<br>
Which us'd to mark with leanness whom it girded.<br>
As in Socrate, Constantine besought<br>
To cure his leprosy Sylvester's aid,<br>
So me to cure the fever of his pride<br>
This man besought: my counsel to that end<br>
He ask'd: and I was silent: for his words<br>
Seem'd drunken: but forthwith he thus resum'd:<br>
"From thy heart banish fear: of all offence<br>
I hitherto absolve thee. &nbsp;In return,<br>
Teach me my purpose so to execute,<br>
That Penestrino cumber earth no more.<br>
Heav'n, as thou knowest, I have power to shut<br>
And open: and the keys are therefore twain,<br>
The which my predecessor meanly priz'd."<br>
<br>Then, yielding to the forceful arguments,<br>
Of silence as more perilous I deem'd,<br>
And answer'd: "Father! since thou washest me<br>
Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall,<br>
Large promise with performance scant, be sure,<br>
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat."<br>
<br>"When I was number'd with the dead, then came<br>
Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark<br>
He met, who cried: "'Wrong me not; he is mine,<br>
And must below to join the wretched crew,<br>
For the deceitful counsel which he gave.<br>
E'er since I watch'd him, hov'ring at his hair,<br>
No power can the impenitent absolve;<br>
Nor to repent and will at once consist,<br>
By contradiction absolute forbid."<br>
Oh mis'ry! how I shook myself, when he<br>
Seiz'd me, and cried, "Thou haply thought'st me not<br>
A disputant in logic so exact."<br>
To Minos down he bore me, and the judge<br>
Twin'd eight times round his callous back the tail,<br>
Which biting with excess of rage, he spake:<br>
'This is a guilty soul, that in the fire<br>
Must vanish.' &nbsp;Hence perdition-doom'd I rove<br>
A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb."<br>
<br>When he had thus fulfill'd his words, the flame<br>
In dolour parted, beating to and fro,<br>
And writhing its sharp horn. &nbsp;We onward went,<br>
I and my leader, up along the rock,<br>
Far as another arch, that overhangs<br>
The foss, wherein the penalty is paid<br>
Of those, who load them with committed sin.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXVIII</h2>
<br>

<p>WHO, e'en in words unfetter'd, might at full<br>
Tell of the wounds and blood that now I saw,<br>
Though he repeated oft the tale? No tongue<br>
So vast a theme could equal, speech and thought<br>
Both impotent alike. &nbsp;If in one band<br>
Collected, stood the people all, who e'er<br>
Pour'd on Apulia's happy soil their blood,<br>
Slain by the Trojans, and in that long war<br>
When of the rings the measur'd booty made<br>
A pile so high, as Rome's historian writes<br>
Who errs not, with the multitude, that felt<br>
The grinding force of Guiscard's Norman steel,<br>
And those the rest, whose bones are gather'd yet<br>
At Ceperano, there where treachery<br>
Branded th' Apulian name, or where beyond<br>
Thy walls, O Tagliacozzo, without arms<br>
The old Alardo conquer'd; and his limbs<br>
One were to show transpierc'd, another his<br>
Clean lopt away; a spectacle like this<br>
Were but a thing of nought, to the' hideous sight<br>
Of the ninth chasm. &nbsp;A rundlet, that hath lost<br>
Its middle or side stave, gapes not so wide,<br>
As one I mark'd, torn from the chin throughout<br>
Down to the hinder passage: 'twixt the legs<br>
Dangling his entrails hung, the midriff lay<br>
Open to view, and wretched ventricle,<br>
That turns th' englutted aliment to dross.<br>
<br>Whilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze,<br>
He ey'd me, with his hands laid his breast bare,<br>
And cried; "Now mark how I do rip me! lo!<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/28-259.jpg"><img alt="28-259b.jpg (51K)" src="images/28-259b.jpg" height="541" width="350"></a>

"How is Mohammed mangled! before me<br>
Walks Ali weeping, from the chin his face<br>
Cleft to the forelock; and the others all<br>
Whom here thou seest, while they liv'd, did sow<br>
Scandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent.<br>
A fiend is here behind, who with his sword<br>
Hacks us thus cruelly, slivering again<br>
Each of this ream, when we have compast round<br>
The dismal way, for first our gashes close<br>
Ere we repass before him. &nbsp;But say who<br>
Art thou, that standest musing on the rock,<br>
Haply so lingering to delay the pain<br>
Sentenc'd upon thy crimes?"&mdash;"Him death not yet,"<br>
My guide rejoin'd, "hath overta'en, nor sin<br>
Conducts to torment; but, that he may make<br>
Full trial of your state, I who am dead<br>
Must through the depths of hell, from orb to orb,<br>
Conduct him. &nbsp;Trust my words, for they are true."<br>
<br>More than a hundred spirits, when that they heard,<br>
Stood in the foss to mark me, through amazed,<br>
Forgetful of their pangs. &nbsp;"Thou, who perchance<br>
Shalt shortly view the sun, this warning thou<br>
Bear to Dolcino: bid him, if he wish not<br>
Here soon to follow me, that with good store<br>
Of food he arm him, lest impris'ning snows<br>
Yield him a victim to Novara's power,<br>
No easy conquest else." &nbsp;With foot uprais'd<br>
For stepping, spake Mohammed, on the ground<br>
Then fix'd it to depart. &nbsp;Another shade,<br>
Pierc'd in the throat, his nostrils mutilate<br>
E'en from beneath the eyebrows, and one ear<br>
Lopt off, who with the rest through wonder stood<br>
Gazing, before the rest advanc'd, and bar'd<br>
His wind-pipe, that without was all o'ersmear'd<br>
With crimson stain. &nbsp;"O thou!" said 'he, "whom sin<br>
Condemns not, and whom erst (unless too near<br>
Resemblance do deceive me) I aloft<br>
Have seen on Latian ground, call thou to mind<br>
Piero of Medicina, if again<br>
Returning, thou behold'st the pleasant land<br>
That from Vercelli slopes to Mercabo;<br>

"And there instruct the twain, whom Fano boasts<br>
Her worthiest sons, Guido and Angelo,<br>
That if 't is giv'n us here to scan aright<br>
The future, they out of life's tenement<br>
Shall be cast forth, and whelm'd under the waves<br>
Near to Cattolica, through perfidy<br>
Of a fell tyrant. &nbsp;'Twixt the Cyprian isle<br>
And Balearic, ne'er hath Neptune seen<br>
An injury so foul, by pirates done<br>
Or Argive crew of old. &nbsp;That one-ey'd traitor<br>
(Whose realm there is a spirit here were fain<br>
His eye had still lack'd sight of) them shall bring<br>
To conf'rence with him, then so shape his end,<br>
That they shall need not 'gainst Focara's wind<br>
Offer up vow nor pray'r." &nbsp;I answering thus:<br>
<br>"Declare, as thou dost wish that I above<br>
May carry tidings of thee, who is he,<br>
In whom that sight doth wake such sad remembrance?"<br>
<br>Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheek-bone<br>
Of one, his fellow-spirit, and his jaws<br>
Expanding, cried: "Lo! this is he I wot of;<br>
He speaks not for himself: the outcast this<br>
Who overwhelm'd the doubt in Caesar's mind,<br>
Affirming that delay to men prepar'd<br>
Was ever harmful. &nbsp;"Oh &nbsp;how terrified<br>
Methought was Curio, from whose throat was cut<br>
The tongue, which spake that hardy word. &nbsp;Then one<br>
Maim'd of each hand, uplifted in the gloom<br>
The bleeding stumps, that they with gory spots<br>
Sullied his face, and cried: 'Remember thee<br>
Of Mosca, too, I who, alas! exclaim'd,<br>
"The deed once done there is an end," that prov'd<br>
A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race."<br>
<br>I added: "Ay, and death to thine own tribe."<br>
<br>Whence heaping woe on woe he hurried off,<br>
As one grief stung to madness. &nbsp;But I there<br>
Still linger'd to behold the troop, and saw<br>
Things, such as I may fear without more proof<br>
To tell of, but that conscience makes me firm,<br>
The boon companion, who her strong breast-plate<br>
Buckles on him, that feels no guilt within<br>
And bids him on and fear not. &nbsp;Without doubt<br>
I saw, and yet it seems to pass before me,<br>
A headless trunk, that even as the rest<br>
Of the sad flock pac'd onward. &nbsp;By the hair<br>
It bore the sever'd member, lantern-wise<br>
Pendent in hand, which look'd at us and said,<br>

<a href="images/28-265.jpg"><img alt="28-265b.jpg (51K)" src="images/28-265b.jpg" height="546" width="353"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"Woe's me!" &nbsp;The spirit lighted thus himself,<br>
And two there were in one, and one in two.<br>
How that may be he knows who ordereth so.<br>
<br>When at the bridge's foot direct he stood,<br>
His arm aloft he rear'd, thrusting the head<br>
Full in our view, that nearer we might hear<br>
The words, which thus it utter'd: "Now behold<br>
This grievous torment, thou, who breathing go'st<br>
To spy the dead; behold if any else<br>
Be terrible as this. &nbsp;And that on earth<br>
Thou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I<br>
Am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John<br>
The counsel mischievous. &nbsp;Father and son<br>
I set at mutual war. &nbsp;For Absalom<br>
And David more did not Ahitophel,<br>
Spurring them on maliciously to strife.<br>
For parting those so closely knit, my brain<br>
Parted, alas! I carry from its source,<br>
That in this trunk inhabits. &nbsp;Thus the law<br>
Of retribution fiercely works in me."</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
